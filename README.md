# workit-main

## Workit main first challenge.

Using pure html and css I completed this website design. This is my first, hopefully of many.
I had some trouble trying to figure out the best approach for responsive design. I decided to finish for **desktop only** instead of being bogged down and never finishing. 
I plan to delve into all the responsive design theories (mobile first etc.) and then try designing another site using these principles.

Please let me know if you have any feedback, happy coding!
